### Minimize Feedback Delay from the Front Lines
How can I be in every conversation when I can't be in every conversation?

- Use real-time communication tools.
- Streamline and/or automate feedback loops.
- Act on insights immediately.

### Bias Towards Action
What can I do right now to make progress or learn, even if it’s imperfect?

- Focus on incremental wins.
- Move quickly, test, and iterate.
- Avoid analysis paralysis.

### Keep Strong Opinions, Loosely Held
Be confident in my decisions, but flexible enough to adapt as new data emerges.

- Encourage constructive debate.
- Challenge assumptions regularly.
- Pivot when new insights arise.

### Context is King (Discovery!)
Understand the problem deeply before jumping into solutions.

- Immerse myself in user pain points. What's been tried before? What's not working? What progress are we trying to make?
- Use both qualitative and quantitative data.
- Share context with the people that need it.

### PM is a Team Sport
Collaboration is key—diverse perspectives lead to better decisions and stronger products.

- Value input and pushback from all team members.
- Build trust across departments.
- Ensure alignment throughout the process.

### Constraints Are My Friend
I use limitations as a catalyst for innovation and focus.

- I work creatively within constraints.
- Prioritize core features.
- I simplify where possible.

### Simplicity Over Complexity
Prioritize simplicity to create clear, effective products.

- What can I remove here? Addition via subtraction.
- Focus on clarity and ease of use.
- Avoid unnecessary features.

### Perfectionsim Sucks
I ship quickly and iterate often instead of waiting for perfection.

- I release MVPs early for feedback.
- Iterate and improve based on data.
- Accept imperfection as part of progress.

### Data Rules Everything Around Me
I use qualitative and quantitative data to make product and management decisions.

- What am I basing this decision off of? (Confidence?)
- What was the outcome of this decision?
- How can I improve the next decision?

### I'm Always Willing to Kill My Darlings
Let go of features or ideas that no longer serve our goals.

- I strive to be objective, not emotionally attached.
- Validate features early.
- Prioritize the most impactful work.
