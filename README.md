### Bias Towards Action
What can I do right now to make progress or learn, even if itâ€™s imperfect? Move quickly, test, and iterate. Avoid analysis paralysis.

### PM is a Team Sport
Collaboration is key. Diverse perspectives lead to better decisions and stronger products. Encourage feedback and pushback from colleages. How can I minimize feedback delay from the front lines?

### Simplicity Over Complexity
Prioritize simplicity to create clear, effective products. What can I remove here? Embrace addition via subtraction.

### Context is King
Understand the problem deeply before jumping into solutions. What's been tried before? What's not working? What progress are we trying to make?

### Willing to Kill My Darlings
I gladly let go of features or ideas that no longer serve our goals.

### Data Rules Everything Around Me
What data am I basing this decision off of? How confident am I? What was the outcome? How can I improve the next decision?

### Strong Opinions, Loosely Held
Be confident in my decisions, but flexible enough to adapt as new data emerges. Challenge assumptions regularly. Pivot when new insights warrant it.
